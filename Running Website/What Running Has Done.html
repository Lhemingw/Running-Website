    <p class="box"> Someone that was raised in the 80's with a learning disability that was not diagnosed was not in *existing a person was *torrcered a lot being "Too wierd."  This included teachers along with kids
        both wanted me to fail. They both did really good job making sure I did later on in adulthood.  I grew up not knowing what success was, 
        seeing my brother being successful by running I wanted to try to see if I could learn success after all I was forced to realize I was always a loser, 
        will always be by people.  I knew if I found one success I can bring it into all my life.
